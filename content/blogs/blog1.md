Novi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia and the capital of the northern province called Vojvodina. Lying on the banks of the Danube river, the city faces the northern slopes of Fru≈°ka Gora. Novi Sad was founded in 1694 when Serb merchants formed a colony across the Danube from the Petrovaradin Fortress, a strategic Habsburg military post. In subsequent centuries, it became an important trading, manufacturing and cultural centre, and has historically been dubbed the Serbian Athens. The city was heavily devastated in the 1848 Revolution, but was subsequently rebuilt and restored. Today, along with the Serbian capital city of Belgrade, Novi Sad is an industrial and financial center important to the Serbian economy. 
Notable citizens include Monika Seles, ex world tennis number 1 and Ivana Spanovic, one of the best long jumpers in the world.
